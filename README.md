# ChestXRayClassification
Implementation of DenseNet-121 on the CheXpert Dataset.
This repository is a faithful implementation of the DenseNet-121 image classification model on the chexpert dataset provided by the stanford ML group.
<br>
## Dataset
The dataset can be requested through this link : [chexpert-stanford ml](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) 
<br>
A great way to understand how the labelencoder works in assigning the classes could be through this paper [Irwin & Rajpurkar et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07031) at stanford ML.
## Structure
The repository contains a interactive python notebook which contains the pre-processing, training and testing of the dataset on the chexpert data.
